Here you can summarise what [[Experiment Tracking]] actually is and summarise some of the tools that have been considered.

We may give a quick summary of [[MLflow]] and what makes it different to [[Weights & Biases]].

There's no need to list all of the [[Experiment Tracking]] tools considered as we can rely on backlinks to [[Experiment Tracking]] to do that for us.
