⚠️ **BREAKING CHANGE:** The Starlight Obsidian plugin no longer [overrides](https://starlight.astro.build/guides/overriding-components/) the [`<PageSidebar>` component](https://starlight.astro.build/reference/overrides/#pagesidebar). If you were manually rendering `starlight-obsidian/overrides/PageSidebar.astro` in a custom override, you can now remove it.
