import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components'

A [Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build) plugin to publish [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) vaults to a Starlight website.

Check out the [demo](https://starlight-obsidian.vercel.app/demo/hello/) for a preview of the generated pages.

:::caution[Work in progress]

The Starlight Obsidian plugin is in early development.
If you find something that's not working, [open an issue](https://github.com/HiDeoo/starlight-obsidian/issues/new/choose) on GitHub.

You should also always check that the rendered pages are correct and only include the content you want to publish before publishing your website.

:::

## Prerequisites

You will need to have a Starlight website set up.
If you don't have one yet, you can follow the ["Getting Started"](https://starlight.astro.build/getting-started) guide in the Starlight docs to create one.

## Install the plugin

Starlight Obsidian is a Starlight [plugin](https://starlight.astro.build/reference/plugins/).
Install it using your favorite package manager:

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="npm">

```sh
npm install starlight-obsidian
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="pnpm">

```sh
pnpm add starlight-obsidian
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Yarn">

```sh
yarn add starlight-obsidian
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Bun">

```sh
bun add starlight-obsidian
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="ni">

```sh
ni starlight-obsidian
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::note

If your vault contains diagrams and charts relying on [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/), you will also need to install [Playwright](https://playwright.dev):

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="npm">

```sh
npx playwright install --with-deps chromium
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="pnpm">

```sh
pnpm dlx playwright install --with-deps chromium
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Yarn">

```sh
yarn dlx playwright install --with-deps chromium
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Bun">

```sh
bunx playwright install --with-deps chromium
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="ni">

```sh
nlx playwright install --with-deps chromium
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Configure the plugin

The Starlight Obsidian plugin can be configured in your Starlight [configuration](https://starlight.astro.build/reference/configuration/#plugins) in the `astro.config.mjs` file.
The minimal configuration requires a `vault` option to point to the path of your Obsidian vault.

```diff lang="js" "../path/to/obsidian/vault"
// astro.config.mjs
import starlight from '@astrojs/starlight'
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config'
+import starlightObsidian, { obsidianSidebarGroup } from 'starlight-obsidian'

export default defineConfig({
  integrations: [
    starlight({
+      plugins: [
+        // Generate the Obsidian vault pages.
+        starlightObsidian({
+          vault: '../path/to/obsidian/vault',
+        }),
+      ],
      sidebar: [
        {
          label: 'Guides',
          items: [{ label: 'Example Guide', link: '/guides/example/' }],
        },
+        // Add the generated sidebar group to the sidebar.
+        obsidianSidebarGroup,
      ],
      title: 'My Docs',
    }),
  ],
})
```

To preview the generated pages, you can [start the development server](https://starlight.astro.build/getting-started/#start-the-development-server).
The Starlight Obsidian plugin behavior can be tweaked using various [configuration options](/configuration).
