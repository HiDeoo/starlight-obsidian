import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components'

A [Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build) plugin to publish [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) vaults to a Starlight website.

Check out the [demo](https://starlight-obsidian.vercel.app/demo/hello/) for a preview of the generated pages.

:::note

You should also always check that the rendered pages are correct and only include the content you want to publish before publishing your website.

:::

## Prerequisites

You will need to have a Starlight website set up.
If you don't have one yet, you can follow the ["Getting Started"](https://starlight.astro.build/getting-started) guide in the Starlight docs to create one.

## Installation

import { Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components'
import { PackageManagers } from '@hideoo/starlight-plugins-docs-components'

<Steps>

1. Starlight Obsidian is a Starlight [plugin](https://starlight.astro.build/reference/plugins/). Install it using your favorite package manager:

   <PackageManagers pkg="starlight-obsidian" />

   :::note

   If your vault contains diagrams and charts relying on [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/), you will also need to install [Playwright](https://playwright.dev):

   <PackageManagers type="exec" pkg="playwright" args="install --with-deps chromium" />

   :::

2. Configure the plugin in your Starlight [configuration](https://starlight.astro.build/reference/configuration/#plugins) in the `astro.config.mjs` file.

   The minimal configuration requires a `vault` option to point to the path of your Obsidian vault.

   ```diff lang="js" "../path/to/obsidian/vault"
   // astro.config.mjs
   import starlight from '@astrojs/starlight'
   import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config'
   +import starlightObsidian, { obsidianSidebarGroup } from 'starlight-obsidian'

   export default defineConfig({
     integrations: [
       starlight({
   +      plugins: [
   +        // Generate the Obsidian vault pages.
   +        starlightObsidian({
   +          vault: '../path/to/obsidian/vault',
   +        }),
   +      ],
         sidebar: [
           {
             label: 'Guides',
             items: [{ label: 'Example Guide', link: '/guides/example/' }],
           },
   +        // Add the generated sidebar group to the sidebar.
   +        obsidianSidebarGroup,
         ],
         title: 'My Docs',
       }),
     ],
   })
   ```

3. [Start the development server](https://starlight.astro.build/getting-started/#start-the-development-server) to preview your vault pages.

</Steps>

The Starlight Obsidian plugin behavior can be tweaked using various [configuration options](/configuration).
